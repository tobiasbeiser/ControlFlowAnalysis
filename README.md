# Control Flow Analysis (0-CFA)
Implementation of a Constraint-Based Control Flow Analysis as part of the course "Program and Resource Analysis" at University of Innsbruck.  
Based on Miniproject 3.3 from the book [Principles of Program Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-03811-6).    

This project uses openjdk-19  

Usage:  
~~~
java -jar ControlFlowAnalysis.jar path/to/program.fun
~~~

The Analysis takes as inout a program written in the FUN language, a minimalistic functional programming language described in the book.
It is then parsed it into an AST by a parser generated by [sableCC](https://sablecc.org/).


This AST is then used to generate labels for each node in the AST via the PrettyVisitorWithLabels class.
These labels are then used in conjunction with the AST to generate the constraints for the program (ConstraintVisitor) based on the rules described in Section 3.4 in the book.  

The constraints are then solved with the graph-based worklist algorithm (Table 3.7 in the book).
